--- TASK METADATA ---
domain_knowledge: |
  Tasks always belong to a project, so they always have the field projectID even when updating a task or making an assignment. 
  To update existing tasks, you must include the taskID in the request. 
  Tasks may also have subtasks, in which case they have a parent task (parentID) and a projectID.
  Tasks frequently have an assignment to a user, team, or role.
  Tasks can have both a plannedCompletionDate and a actualCompletionDate - if you want to know the actual date something was completed, use actualCompletionDate.
  Assignments can be added when creating an task by adding appropriate ids to the assignments array.
  A task name is always required.
  To set a Due Date, set the taskConstraint to MFO and the constraintDate to the desired date.  
  To set a Start Date, set the taskConstraint to MSO and the constraintDate to the desired date.
  Default statuses include: New, In Progress, and Complete
  Tasks include a taskNumber.  The task number shows the order the task appears in a list as shown to the user.  The user may referer to a task by its task number instead of its name.
  If a user refers to a task by its number insetead of its name, then it will need to be search by taskNumber instead of name to find the task id.  i.e. I want to rename task 3 to "New Task Name"

Use the following metadata for the TASK object when generating JSON queries:

OBJECT: TASK

Fields:
- ID (string)
- name (string)
- status (string)
- priority (int; 0=None, 1=Low, 2=Normal, 3=High, 4=Urgent)
- plannedCompletionDate (dateTime)
- actualCompletionDate (dateTime)
- lastUpdateDate (dateTime)
- percentComplete (double)
- assignedToID (string)
- project:name (string) ← from project reference
- project:status (string) ← from project reference

Nested & Reference Fields:
- assignedTo:name (string) ← from assignedTo reference (USER)
- assignments:role:name (string) ← role assigned to user(s)
- assignments:assignedTo:name (string) ← user(s) assigned
- assignments:assignmentPercent (double) ← percent allocation
- assignments:status (string) ← assignment-level status

Relationships:
- assignedTo → USER
- project → PROJ
- assignments → [assignment object] containing role, assignedTo, and status

Common Filter Operators:
- _Mod: "isnull" → to check for unassigned fields
- _Mod: "between" + _Range → for date range filters
- _Mod: "cicontains" → for partial text matches
- _Mod: "eq", "lt", "gt", etc. → for value comparisons

Use this metadata to select fields and create accurate filters in your JSON responses.
