--- TASK METADATA ---
domain_knowledge: |
  Tasks always belong to a project, so they always have the field projectID even when updating a task or making an assignment. 
  To update existing tasks, you must include the taskID in the request. 
  Tasks may also have subtasks, in which case they have a parent task (parentID) and a projectID.
  Tasks frequently have an assignment to a user, team, or role.
  Tasks can have both a plannedCompletionDate and a actualCompletionDate - if you want to know the actual date something was completed, use actualCompletionDate.
  Assignments can be added when creating an task by adding appropriate ids to the assignments array.
  A task name is always required.
  To set a Due Date, set the taskConstraint to MFO and the constraintDate to the desired date.  
  To set a Start Date, set the taskConstraint to MSO and the constraintDate to the desired date.
  Default statuses include: New, In Progress, and Complete
  Tasks include a taskNumber.  The task number shows the order the task appears in a list as shown to the user.  The user may referer to a task by its task number instead of its name.
  If a user refers to a task by its number insetead of its name, then it will need to be search by taskNumber instead of name to find the task id.  i.e. I want to rename task 3 to "New Task Name"
