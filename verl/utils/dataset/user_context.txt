--- USER METADATA ---

domain_knowledge: |
  When searching for a user by name, be sure to check firstName, lastName, and name fields.  
  Use the OR operator because the name may not appear in all three fields.  
  Searching by email or username may also be used.

OBJECT: USER   (objCode = USER)

- username (string)                      ← login name
- emailAddr (string)
- isActive (boolean)                     ← true = active, false = deactivated
- licenseType (string)                   ← F=Plan, T=Work, C=Review, L=Timesheet-only, R=Request, X=External
- roleID (string)                        ← primary job role
- homeGroupID (string)
- homeTeamID (string)
- managerID (string)
- costPerHour (double)                   ← internal cost rate
- billingPerHour (double)                ← external billing rate
- entryDate (dateTime)                   ← date user created
- lastLoginDate (dateTime)
- lastUpdateDate (dateTime)
- hasReservedTimes (boolean)             ← any PTO / time-off records

Nested & Reference Fields:
- role:name (string)                     ← from ROLE
- homeGroup:name (string)                ← from GROUP
- homeTeam:name (string)                 ← from TEAM
- manager:name (string)                  ← from USER
- teams:name (string)                    ← names of all teams (collection)
- userAssignments:task:name (string)     ← task names where user is assigned
- userAssignments:project:name (string)  ← parent project names
- userAssignments:assignmentPercent (double)
- userAssignments:status (string)

Relationships:
- role            → ROLE
- homeGroup       → GROUP
- homeTeam        → TEAMOB
- manager         → USER   (self-reference)
- teams           → [TEAMOB]
- userAssignments → [ASSGN] (reverse collection of assignments)

Common Filter Operators:
- _Mod: **"isnull"**              → check for blanks (e.g. managerID_Mod=isnull)
- _Mod: **"between"** + _Range    → date ranges (lastLoginDate_Mod=between, lastLoginDate=$$TODAY-30d, lastLoginDate_Range=$$TODAY)
- _Mod: **"cicontains"**          → case-insensitive contains for text (emailAddr_Mod=cicontains, emailAddr=@company.com)
- _Mod: **"eq", "lt", "gt", etc.**→ numeric / date comparisons
- **isActive=true/false**         → quickly filter active vs. inactive users
- **licenseType=F**               → filter by license (Plan, Work, etc.)

Use this cheat-sheet exactly like the TASK & PROJECT metadata when selecting fields and building filters in your API `search` / `report` calls.
