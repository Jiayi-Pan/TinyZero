--- PROJECT METADATA ---
domain_knowledge:|
  Projects represent the main container of work that is to be completed. A Project may contain many different tasks or issues. Projects have both a plannedCompletionDate 
  which represents an estimate or planned completion date, and also a actualCompletionDate which represents the actual completion date of the project. If you are looking
  for when things actually completed use the actualCompletionDate, if you are wanting to know when something is planned to be completed use the plannedCompletionDate.
  Default Statuses include: Current, Dead, On Hold, Planning, Complete, Requested, Approved, Rejected, and Idea

  OBJECT: PROJECT   (objCode = PROJ)

Fields:
- ID (string)
- name (string)
- status (string; CUR = Current, PLN = Planning, CPL = Complete, ONH = On Hold, DED = Dead, REQ = Requested, APR = Approved, REJ = Rejected, IDA = Idea)
- priority (int; 0=None, 1=Low, 2=Normal, 3=High, 4=Urgent)
- plannedStartDate (dateTime)
- plannedCompletionDate (dateTime)
- actualStartDate (dateTime)
- actualCompletionDate (dateTime)
- lastUpdateDate (dateTime)
- percentComplete (double)
- ownerID (string)
- teamID (string)
- entryDate (dateTime)

Reference / Composite Fields:
- owner:name (string)          ← from USER
- team:name  (string)          ← from TEAM
- portfolio:name / program:name (string)  ← optional filters
- tasks (reverse collection)   ← TASK objects with projectID = this project

Relationships:
- owner      → USER
- team       → TEAM
- tasks      → TASK (via projectID)

Common Filter Operators:
- _Mod: "isnull"              → check for empty fields (e.g. teamID_Mod=isnull)
- _Mod: "between" + _Range    → date ranges (plannedCompletionDate_Mod=between, plannedCompletionDate=$$TODAY, plannedCompletionDate_Range=$$TODAY+10d)
- _Mod: "eq" | "lt" | "lte" | "gt" | "gte" → numeric / date comparisons
- _Mod: "cicontains"          → case-insensitive substring match for text fields (e.g. name_Mod=cicontains, name=Redesign)
